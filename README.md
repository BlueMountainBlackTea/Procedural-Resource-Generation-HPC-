# Procedural-Resource-Generation-HPC

Implementation of Procedural Generation of Resources for HPC course.

## Overview

This project implements a parallel/multiprocessor program focused on procedural resource generation, using multiple programming approaches including serial, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA. The project aims to mimic the behavior of the serial code while exploring different parallelization algorithms. Code profiling and performance analysis are included to optimize and compare implementations.
